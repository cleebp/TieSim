This research investigates the notion of combining emerging Virtual Reality (VR) technology with educational simulations for competency-based learning. This research was carried out through creating a virtual learning simulation that serves to teach a skill, and proposing a study study on college students to see if the particular skill they learned in the simulation can then be performed in real life. More specifically a 3D game world was created using the Unity 3D Game Engine, and the player model was integrated with Oculus Rift DK2 support, and Leap Motion V2 input, to teach college students how to perform a skill in 30 minutes or less (assuming they did not already possess this skill). Many researchers have demonstrated that VR can be used for educational purposes but few strive to actually connect the two on a fundamental level and instead focus on the skill that can be taught. For this reason, this research stands out and fills a gap in the scholarly conversation on VR in the educational realm.
