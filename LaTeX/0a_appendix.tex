\chapter{IRB Materials}
\label{App:appA}

This appendix serves to aid future work on this research by providing the materials necessary to apply and receive IRB approval for the study discussed in Chapter 5: Proposed Study. Materials cannot be submitted exactly as follows, as namely the principle researcher and other researchers associated with the materials will have changed. Additionally, details regarding the study may change and as such should be reflected in any future edits to these materials. This being said, if the majority of the content submitted follows the guidelines demonstrated by these materials, one will almost certainly receive IRB approval. 

The first section of this appendix covers participant recruitment, and is a copy of an example email which would be sent to seek participants for the proposed study. More information can be found in section 5.2: Recruitment.

The second section of this appendix covers participant consent, and is a copy of the consent form which would have been used to gather participant consent prior to participating in this proposed study. More information can be found in section 5.3: Consent.

Finally, the third section of this appendix covers follow up questions which would be asked after a participant finishes the training simulation. The form included is a rough draft and could easily be expanded to gather more data on the participant's experience. More information can be found in section 5.6: Data.
