In the end this thesis would not exist if it were not for the encouragement and support from a handful of wonderful people. My thesis director, Dee Parks, believed in me throughout my undergraduate career and without her support I would not be in the position I am today. Both as an advisor, a professor, and a friend Dr. Parks is a one of a kind teacher and mentor that any student would be blessed to have. Additionally, I can't forget to thank my parents who encouraged me throughout my educational career, and have always believed in whatever crazy direction I lead my life. And finally, my best friend, and girlfriend, Danielle Russell, who never ceases to inspire me and make me a better person. Thank you all so very much.
